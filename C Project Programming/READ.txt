C Programming Project!!
--------------------------
ICT_Restaurant

	ICT_Restaurant is once a program that was created for use with the restaurant system. The employee can book

tables, order foods, check bills and check the status in each table. The program can save data form this program in

data.exe after running this program, like user books table's 1 and customer orders food and drink, after user inputs

data in this program and exit program by type "0", the program will save data in data.exe. When user run the program again,

the program will read data.exe and push the table's 1 data to the program.

    This program is my first C project and I write it by myself since I was a year 1 student.
